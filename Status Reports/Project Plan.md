**Project: VCU Health ECMO Lifetime Prediction**

**Project Description: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a treatment that circulate blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream of a patient with failed lungs. One challenging problem is that blood clogs in the bloodstream may cause strokes or brain damage to patients if not detected at early stage. This research is to develop a tool that analyzes the captured images of bloodstream and produces early warning signals of the formation of bloodclogs in the ECMO bloodsteam. This project can be used to help Covid 19 patients who rely on ECMO for life extension.**

**Problem Definition: 1. Build an image capturing system that can capture the snapshots of bloodstream.
2. Develop a machine-learning tool to evaluate the life spam of a bloodstream though image analysis.**
