**Project:**

ECMO lifetime prediction through image analysis using machine learning Part 2

**Project Description:**

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a treatment that circulates blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream of a patient with failed lungs. One challenging problem is that blood clogs in the bloodstream may cause strokes or brain damage to patients if not detected at early stage. This research is to develop a tool that analyzes the captured images of bloodstream and produces early warning signals of the formation of bloodclogs in the ECMO bloodsteam. This project can be used to help Covid 19 patients who rely on ECMO for life extension.
